# ViewPager Walkthrough

Demo application which makes use of ViewPager and Fragments to guide user through a walkthrough screen for your app. Apart from that I used Apple's 
[San Francisco](https://github.com/supermarin/YosemiteSanFranciscoFont) font for fun. So the ViewPager uses FragmentStatePageAdapter which has four pages.

I got the icons from [Oxygenna's Dribbble page](https://dribbble.com/shots/2404920-Free-Set-of-Document-Icons#comment-4889571). It's a freebie, so feel free to use it.
The tab indicators at the bottom are shapes that are made using android drawables.
